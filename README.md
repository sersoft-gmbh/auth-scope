Handle authentication scopes with ease.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following package dependency to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/sersoft-gmbh/auth-scope.git", from: "3.0.0"),
```

## Usage

The main object you want to use is `Scope<AccessRange>`. It's generic and wraps all the logic around a given `AccessRange` type. Since `Scope` can't know what access ranges you have, you need to provide them yourself. Typically, this is done by using an `enum` and conforming it to `AccessRangeProtocol`:
```swift
enum MyAccessRange: String, AccessRangeProtocol, CaseIterable {
    case readPosts = "posts:read"
    case writePosts = "posts:write"

    case readUsers = "users:read"
    case writeUsers = "users:write"
}
```

You can then use your `enum` with `Scope`:
```swift
let postsScope = Scope<MyAccessRange>(accessRanges: .readPosts, .writePosts)

postsScope.contains(.writePosts) // -> true
postsScope.contains(.readUsers) // -> false
```

`Scope` conforms to `SetAlgebra` to make checking access ranges easier:
```swift
let completeScope = Scope<MyAccessRange>.all // `.all` is available when `AccessRange` conforms to `CaseIterable`
completeScope.isSuperset(of: postsScope) // -> true
```

`Scope` is also able to generate a "scope string", since this is usually how they're provided to APIs. The "scope string" contains all access ranges (their `rawValue` to be exact) separated by space. It's important to note that `Scope` does not keep the access ranges in a given order. This means, that it's not guaranteed that two calls to `scopeString` will contain the access ranges in the same order. It is guaranteed, however, that the resulting scope contains all access ranges. `Scope` can of course also be created from a scope string. This initializer will throw an error if any of the contained access ranges is not valid.

```swift
let usersScope: Scope<MyAccessRange> = [.readUsers, .writeUsers]
let string = usersScope.scopeString // -> "users:read users:write" OR "users:write users:read"
let recreatedScope = try Scope<MyAccessRange>(scopeString: string)
usersScope == recreatedScope // true
```

`Scope` is also `Codable` and encodes/decodes itself as its scope string.

Last but not least, Scope also provides some useful regular expression patterns, that can be used to perform matches on a string basis. This is not recommended if your scopes are available as Swift types, but can be useful if you have to match scopes e.g. in a database.
There are currently three regular expression patterns that are provided:
-   `exactMatchRegExp`: Returns a pattern that matches a scope string that contains **exactly** the same access ranges. Not more and not less.
-   `containsAllRegExp`: Returns a pattern that matches a scope string that contains **all** access ranges, but is allowed to contain more.
-   `containsAnyRegExp`: Returns a pattern that matches a scope string that contains **any** access ranges. A match is made as soon as one access range is contained.

## Documentation

The API is documented using header doc. If you prefer to view the documentation as a webpage, there is an [online version](https://sersoft-gmbh.github.io/auth-scope) available for you.

## Contributing

If you find a bug / like to see a new feature in AuthScope there are a few ways of helping out:

-   If you can fix the bug / implement the feature yourself please do and open a PR.
-   If you know how to code (which you probably do), please add a (failing) test and open a PR. We'll try to get your test green ASAP.
-   If you can do neither, then open an issue. While this might be the easiest way, it will likely take the longest for the bug to be fixed / feature to be implemented.
